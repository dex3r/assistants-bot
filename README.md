# assistants-bot
Discord bot that uses OpenAI Assistants API v2.

# Configuration
Example configuration can be found in the `.env.sample` file. 
Rename it to `.env`, comment out the commented variables and fill them in.

For production, I recommend storing the secrets in environment variables instead.

# Running the bot
### Running from source
Execute the following command in the root directory of the project:
```bash
npm run start
```

### Running in Docker
